I have chosen Random Forest classifier because it had the highest accuracy and F1 score amongst tested classifiers. It also performs better on validation dataset in comparison with the model proposed by default. I compared the classifiers with those measures because in this task we are interested in predicting the survival status of people so accuracy allows to optimize model well and F1 score, made of precision and recall, can help to learn more about the model.
